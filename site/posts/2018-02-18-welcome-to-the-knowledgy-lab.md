Welcome, readers, to the first post of this journey I call *_Knowledgy Lab_*. Within this space, you will find future posts on learning technologies and family engagement. I would like to use this space to write about the key role of educational media and learning technologies in helping families engage with one another.

I look forward to engaging readers in thoughtful posts about the need for adding families to the STEM equation – to help close the gap in the STEM pipeline for children. I will write about how learning technologies and family STEM inclusion can help empower families to unlock their children’s potential for learning.

I will also share some of my learning experiences in the <a href="https://gsep.pepperdine.edu/doctorate-learning-technologies/admission-requirements/">Doctor of Education in Learning Technologies</a> program at Pepperdine Universtiy. I’ll share about the classes, research, and the international trips (hello Belize 2018!) to give a snap shot of a doctoral student. If you have questions about the program, please reach out. I would love to share some of the insights.

I am thrilled to start this new journey with all of you. Please stay tuned to this blog/website and hope you share your thoughts in the comments sessions.
